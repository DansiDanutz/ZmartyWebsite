## 🕐 DNS Propagation Timeline

### What to Expect:

**0-15 minutes**:
- DNS starts propagating globally
- Some locations may see the new site

**15-30 minutes**:
- Most DNS servers updated
- Netlify detects DNS change
- HTTPS certificate provisioning begins

**30 minutes - 2 hours**:
- Full global propagation
- HTTPS certificate active
- Site fully live at https://zmarty.me

**Maximum (rare)**:
- Up to 24-48 hours for complete global propagation
- But usually much faster (30 min - 2 hours)

---

## 🔍 How to Check Progress

### Option 1: DNS Propagation Checker
Visit: https://dnschecker.org
- Enter: `zmarty.me`
- Should show IP: `75.2.60.5`
- Green checkmarks = propagated in that location

### Option 2: Terminal Command
```bash
dig zmarty.me
```
Look for: `75.2.60.5` in the ANSWER section

### Option 3: Direct Browser Test
Clear browser cache and visit:
- http://zmarty.me (may redirect to https automatically)
- https://zmarty.me (will work after HTTPS cert provisions)

### Option 4: Netlify Dashboard
- Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/zmartybrain-onboarding
- Click: Domain settings
- Watch for: "Awaiting External DNS" to change to "Netlify DNS" with checkmark

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If zmarty.me doesn't load after 2 hours:

1. **Check DNS in GoDaddy**:
   - Verify A record: `@` → `75.2.60.5`
   - Verify CNAME: `www` → `zmartybrain-onboarding.netlify.app`

2. **Check Netlify**:
   - Domain settings should show green checkmarks
   - HTTPS should show "Provisioned" or "Active"

3. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - Or try incognito/private browsing

4. **Check DNS Propagation**:
   - Visit: https://dnschecker.org
   - Enter: zmarty.me
   - Should show: 75.2.60.5

### If HTTPS isn't working:

- Netlify automatically provisions SSL certificates
- Usually takes 5-10 minutes after DNS propagates
- If delayed, Netlify will retry automatically
- Can manually trigger in: Netlify → Domain settings → HTTPS → "Renew certificate"
